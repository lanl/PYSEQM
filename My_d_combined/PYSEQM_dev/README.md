# [PYSEQM: PYtorch-based Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics](https://github.com/lanl/PYSEQM)
[PYSEQM](https://github.com/lanl/PYSEQM) is a Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics package implemented in [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org). It provides built-in interfaces for machine learning and efficient molecular dynamic engines with GPU supported. Several molecular dynamics algorithms are implemented for facilitating dynamic simulations, inlcuding orginal and Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics, geometric optimization and  several thermostats.

## Features:

* Interface with machine learning (ML) framework like [HIPNN](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5011181) for ML applications and development.
* GPU-supported Molecular Dynamics Engine
* Stable and Efficient Extended Lagrangian Born Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics ([XL-BOMD](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.3148075))
  * Includes Krylov Subspace Approximation (KSA-XL-BOMD) for more accurate density matrix propagation and handling small HOMO-LUMO gaps
* Efficient expansion algorithm [SP2](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.66.155115) for generating density matrix
