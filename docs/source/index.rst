Welcome to PYSEQM Documentation
==================================

PYSEQM(PYtorch-based Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics) is a Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics package implemented in PyTorch. It provides built-in interfaces for machine learning and efficient molecular dynamic engines with GPU support. 


<<<<<<< HEAD
Several molecular dynamics algorithms are implemented for facilitating dynamics simulations, inlcuding orginal and Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics, geometry optimization and thermostats.
