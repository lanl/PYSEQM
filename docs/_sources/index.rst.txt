Welcome to PYSEQM Documentation
==================================

PYSEQM(PYtorch-based Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics) is a Semi-Empirical Quantum Mechanics package implemented in PyTorch. It provides built-in interfaces for machine learning and efficient molecular dynamic engines with GPU supported. 


Several molecular dynamics algorithms are implemented for facilitating dynamic simulations, inlcuding orginal and Extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics, geometric optimization and several thermostats.
